Messing with video/audio transcriptions -
how to write and time them,
how to play and navigate them.

Using HTML5 Media Elements, Canvas, the Web Audio API and plain JavaScript.

Should work well in Chrome/Safari for MP4/MP3.
Firefox does not supports these formats due to licensing fees.
Internet Explorer does not yet support the Web Audio API.
